# PythoneGame
A python game based on the concept of Space War, serves to a certain group of players who identify themselves as fashion heads. Shallow or outdated cloths and footwears are portraited as the enemy while the valuable pieces can be collected by the player to reload the health point. The player is encouraged to distinguish whether the upcoming target is the "Cringe" or the "Grail". With that being said, this game is designed for players who have a basic understanding and knowledge of the fashion trends and with a sarcastic personality. 
However, since the defination of cringing and valuable are extremely subjective and subtle, the selections used in the game are by no means for offensive or insulting purpose.
People who do not care about fashion at all are still welcome to play.
The background music and other sound/animation effects are sampled by some popular Chinese fashion influencer. Those are for purely meme use.

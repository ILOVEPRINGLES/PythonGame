# PythonGame
A python game based on the concept of Space War, serves to a certain group of players who identify themselves as fashion heads. Shallow or outdated cloths and footwears are portraited as the enemy while the valuable pieces can be collected by the player to reload the health point. The player is encouraged to distinguish whether the upcoming target is the "Cringe" or the "Grail". With that being said, this game is designed for players who have a basic understanding and knowledge of the fashion trends and with a sarcastic personality. 
The background music and other sound/animation effects are sampled by some popular Chinese fashion influencers. Those are purely for meme use.
The python game is converted to exe file such that players with no python installed in their devices are able to install and run the game.
IYKYK.py is the main file. CringeKiller.zip includes image and sound materials and the converted exe file.
